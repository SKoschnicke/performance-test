Results
-------

Rails (in production mode, running with mongrel webserver, ruby 1.8.7) is six times slower than yesod (compiled in production mode).

To reproduce results
--------------------

You will need a PostgreSQL Server, Rails and Yesod installed.

1. Create a Database called "haskell"
2. Import SQL dump

   psql haskell < data.sql

3. Configure the database connection by editing rails-test/config/database.yml

4. In the rails-test directory start the server

   ./script/server

5. Access http://localhost:3000 and measure the time it takes to get 1000 quotes and display the values

6. Configure the database connection by editing yesod-test/Settings.hs (make sure to set the production settings)

7. In the yesod-test directory compile the app in production mode

   cabal install -f "production"

8. Start the app ./dist/build/yesod-test-production/yesod-test-production

9. Access http://localhost:3000/quotes and measure the time it takes to get 1000 quotes and display the values


Testing with siege:

siege -b -c 5 -r 50 localhost:3000
